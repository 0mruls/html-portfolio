<h1>My Life</h1>
<p>
    When the time was September 15, 2004 I was born in Sakarya, Turkey.<br>
    My life went pretty crazy since I was born. I went through ups and downs frequently<br>
    so my relationship with my father was quite different with than people.<br>
    But now, when I look at the past I say "I wish I had different family." rather than <br>"I wish I was different." or smth like that.

<h2>My Plans</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I will learn coding and I will be a professional programmer at the end.<br>
    In order to do that I should:
        <ol>
            <li>Learn to code in HTML lang in 3 days.
                <ul>
                    <li>I should watch Angela Yu's videos and do some practice.</li>
                    <li>I should watch Jonas' videos either.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Learn to code in CSS lang in 4 days.
                <ul>
                    <li>I will do the same in here, watch Angela's and Jonas' vide-<br>os to achieve my goal. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Learning JS is pretty important so I must keep track all 3 courses that I bought.
                <ul>
                    <li>Turkish Course (I forgot the name of the course)</li>
                    <li>Angela Yu's course</li>
                    <li>Jonas' course</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
